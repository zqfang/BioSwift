# Swift-Bio

The feature of Swift I like:
-  First-class `Differentiable` programming: [What's this?](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md)
- `Protocol-orientied` programming:
   - a new and modern programming paradigm 
- `Extension`: 
  - Standard library could be extented. No need to write a wrapper class

But something that I don't like:
- The performance is really poor when parsing large text files.
- Lack of `Numpy`-liked library yet
- No Biocommunity yet 

## Introduction
A collection of toy `command-line` tools written in `Swift` for bioinformatic data wrangling.    
Each tool is a subcommand of `biosw`. 


## Usage:
### Command line
1. Convert GTF to BED format
```shell
biosw gtf2bed gencode.gtf out.bed
```
2. Convert VCF to NIEHS compact format
```shell
biosw vcf2niehs snp.vcf out.txt
```

3. More will be added if worth to.

### Swift REPL
As a library 
```swift
import Bio
let testDataPath = "data"
let gtf = GTF(testDataPath+"/test.gtf")
gtf.toBed(filename: testDataPath+"/test.bed")
```
## Installation
### Build
```shell
cd swift-bio
swift build
# build output in .build/debug

# test if build successfully
swift run biosw
```
###  Release 
```shell
# binary output in .build/release
swift build --configuration release
```

## Dev
### Use `Bio` as depency for your own package
To depend on the Bio API package, you need to declare your dependency in your Package.swift:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/zqfang/swift-bio", from: "0.0.1"),
```
and to your `application/library` target, add `Bio` to your dependencies, e.g. like this:
```
.target(name: "YourApp", dependencies: ["Bio"]),
```


## Others
### 1. Strings and  Grapheme Clusters?   
- Swiftâ€™s String and Character types are fully Unicode-compliant, see [docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html#ID293)
- What `Substring` is:
- startIndex: string slicing ...
-  Why `String` parsing in  Swift is so slow ?

### 2. FileIO system in Swift quit different from C/C++ and Python et.al
Swift is slow when reading large text files with the code like  
```swift
let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource:"test", ofType: "txt")
let lines = try? String(contentsOfFile: path!)
                     .split{$0 == "\n"}
                     .map(String.init)
```
**NOTE**: Since `String` reads the whole file once, instead of line by line, it took a long time to read large size files. Reading file line by line is much more efficiently, but you have to write your own parser.

### 3. An experimental 2D Array with Numpy-like indexing and slicing
`Array2D` is only for testing purpose. Now, we could use `SIMD` as backend.

An example of swift code:

init and assign values
```swift
import Bio
// init 2d array
var arr = Array2D<Int>(rows:10, columns:5, initialValue: 0 )

// init an Array2D by another Array2D instance
let arr2 = Array2D<Int>(arr)

// init a Array2D by generic 2d arry
let arr3 = Array2D<Dobule>([[1.0,2,0],[3.0,4.0]])

// assign value
arr[1,4] = 1 
arr[5,2] = 6

print(arr[5]) // [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]
```

Numpy-like indexing and slicing
```swift
print(arr[[1,3],nil]) 
/* 
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 1], 
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
*/

print(arr[2,nil]) 
// [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

print(arr[1..<6, 3..<5]) 
/* 
[[0, 1], 
 [0, 0], 
 [0, 0], 
 [0, 0], 
 [0, 0]]
*/
```


###  Generate a template Swift package called BioSwift
```
mkdir BioSwift && cd BioSwift
swift package init --type executable
swift package generate-xcodeproj # xcode 
```
